        <p>
          Greetings! I'm Shantel, a software developer with a passion for the
          automotive, entertainment, fishing, and gaming industries. With six
          years of experience in the automotive sector, I decided to make a career
          change after realizing that software development aligns more closely
          with my long-term aspirations. My journey into the world of software
          development began just a year ago when I was introduced to it. Since
          then, I have immersed myself in various programming languages, including
          Python, JavaScript (ES6, Node.js), C#, HTML5, CSS, and SQL. Through
          self-guided learning, I started with follow-along tutorials on YouTube,
          honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base. Motivated by my
          newfound interest, I joined a coding bootcamp to further enhance my
          abilities and gain a holistic understanding of full-stack software
          engineering. Currently, I am focused on Full Stack development, while
          also exploring iOS development and UI/UX design. As a fast learner and
          technology enthusiast, I am driven by challenging problems that foster
          personal growth and help me achieve my goals. I pride myself on being a
          dedicated team player who values effective communication and
          consistently strives for results. I am excited to leverage my diverse
          background and skills to contribute to innovative software solutions in
          collaboration with like-minded professionals. With a strong foundation
          in the automotive industry and a newfound passion for software
          development, I am ready to embark on this transformative journey and
          make a lasting impact in the world of technology.

                <h3>Wedding Invite website</h3>
              <p>
              This project is a wedding e-Vite that lets the people who are invited
              rsvp or decline the invite and the user gets notified with an email
              using node mailer. Using react, html and CSS. I was able to make
              this web application. Also, viewers are able to go to the gift
              registries by clicking on the links and will be directed to the
              respected store they clicked on. I had a hard time getting the
              emails to send but with the help or google and stack overflow I was
              able to get the emails and notifications working. This was a tricky
              but fun application that can be used in real life situations, and I am
              proud of myself with this project.

                <h3>Wizarding World of Harry Potter Spells Generator</h3>
              <p>
              This is a website that generates different spells from the wizarding
              world of harry potter using integrated api's. Utilized Javascript to
              create the function of the generator. Integrated the harry potter
              api spells to get all of the different spells. Used fetch to grab
              the spells and shuffle them. Employed html and css to create the
              page and different fonts.

                    server-side logic [for efficient routing and data management].
                    Conducted thorough testing of routes and APIs using postman
                    application. Utilized the React framework for quick rendering [and
                    enhanced user experience]. Incorporated material-Ui to design buttons
                    and other interactive features.
